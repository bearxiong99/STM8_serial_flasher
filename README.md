STM8_serial_flasher
===================

PC tool for uplading hexfiles to the STM8 microcontroller via COM port or USB using the built-in ROM bootloader of the STM8. 

Works under Windows, MacOSX and Linux operating systems. 

The tool includes some STM8 code by STMicroelectronics (STM), which is required for programming the flash. This code was copied from the freely available "Flash Loader Demonstrator" by STM. Rights to this STM8 code remain with STM.
